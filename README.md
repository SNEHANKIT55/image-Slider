This project involves creating a dynamic and responsive image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to build an engaging and interactive component that can showcase multiple images with smooth transitions, enhancing the user experience on a webpage. The image slider will feature navigation controls to allow users to manually switch between images, as well as an auto-sliding functionality to automatically rotate through the images at set intervals.

Key Features:
HTML Structure: Establishing the foundational layout for the slider, including placeholders for images and navigation controls (previous/next buttons).
CSS Styling: Styling the slider container and images to ensure a visually appealing design. This includes adding transitions and animations for smooth sliding effects and ensuring the design is responsive across different screen sizes.
JavaScript Functionality: Implementing the logic to navigate between images, handle user interactions with the navigation controls, and manage the auto-sliding feature.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the image slider.
CSS: For styling the slider and adding animations/transitions.
JavaScript: For implementing the functionality to navigate between images and handle user interactions.
